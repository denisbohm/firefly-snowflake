Firefly Design LLC - Snowflake Christmas Ornament

The snowflake is a Christmas tree ornament with RGB LEDs that light up in various ways.  It has a rechargeable battery (via micro USB port) and it is controllable via BLE via a Swift app.

This repository has all the files to create a snowflake Christmas ornament.  This includes 3D mechanical files to create the plastic parts, Eagle schematics & layout for the PCBA, PCBA firmware, and Swift App source files.
